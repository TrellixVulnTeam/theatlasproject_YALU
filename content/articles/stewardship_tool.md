Summary: Stewardship is a gift for God to help his people manage the money he has given us. Are you a part of the quarter of Americans who couldn’t afford an emergency expense greater than $400? Or would you have to borrow the money volunteering yourself for slavery? God commands us to live generously, and we limit ourselves through impatience, greed, and irresponsibility.

Living a generous life takes intentionality and preparation. Without the proper structure, well-intentioned favors could turn into nightmares for yourself, but even worse, those you want to help the most. 

It is easy to get caught up in managing our treasures without recognizing the ultimate goal. The reason stewardship is essential is that it fosters a heart of generosity -- it’s not the secret to wealth.

The purpose of this writing isn’t to instill fear but to spark an urgency to serve God using the financial resources he has entrusted to you.

**What living a generous life looks like?**

 

In the first century church, we see that the people of their time sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need. They were not explicitly told to do so, and their salvation didn’t depend on their giving. God saved these same people without any money or financial investment of any kind. I believe that they weren’t immediately concerned with the intentions of the people they helped. Instead, they wanted to express their love for God by loving what God loves most, his people.

**Encouragement to live more generously**



1. God’s committed to our success

God would never instruct us to do anything that would be detrimental to our eternity with him. He plans to prosper us and honor his followers at the proper time. Below are a few scriptures that remind us of his promises:



*   [1 John 5:14-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+5%3A14-15&version=ESV)
*   [Philippians 4:6-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A6-7&version=ESV)
*   [Romans 8:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:27-29&version=ESV#en-ESV-28129)
*   [Matthew 5:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A5&version=NIV)

We are giving up resources that have a clear benefit on earth. In exchange, we have the opportunity to share in the example of sacrifice God has set before us.   



2. Accessing where your treasure is 

    For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. - Matthew 6:21 - NIV


A common analogy to put Matthew 6:21 in perspective is investing in a stock. Let's say we invest 10% of our income into Amazon(AMZN). Naturally, we would be very invested in the success of Amazon. How much more ownership would we take if we invested 10% of our income to a local church where we would have much more influence over the eternity of our neighbors, friends, and family?

The New Testament doesn’t mention tithing, so please don’t feel pressured to tithe.  Jesus does teach about surrendering everything and giving generously and doing so willingly, without complaining. God continually shapes our hearts and minds if we allow him to. I implore you to pray to God for such a heart, and I’m confident he will not disappoint. 



3. Addressing your fears 

    Young Rich Ruler - Matthew 19: 16 - 30, 
    Parable of the Bags of Gold - Matthew 25:14-30


Whether you are unsure of who God is or been a follower of Jesus for decades, our minds can’t fully grasp the sacrifice Jesus made. However, we must not let that stop us from doing our best to please him. Giving up everything is scary and requires a consistent relationship with God to address our doubts and anxieties. I can’t promise that giving earthly riches and managing your money in a God-centered way will make you rich. However, your intentionality will be seen by God, and you will store up eternal treasures for heaven by using your money to help others know him. 

**Next Steps:**

There are so many scriptures on the use of time, talents, and treasure. I have included a few that stand out to me below. To make Jesus Lord of your finances, it requires understanding how he views money and seeking advice from those he has given the ability to manage his money well. 

I look forward to us giving generously.
